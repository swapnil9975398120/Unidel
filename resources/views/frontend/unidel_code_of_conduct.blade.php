					<p>UNIDEL is an entrepreneurial group with a focus on global technology investing and multi-asset class investing.  UNIDEL collectively employs ~200 professionals across Mumbai, Pune, New York City, Silicon Valley and Tokyo.  
						As corporate citizens, we value doing business ethically and would like to build and maintain our reputation as a company that is well respected, trusted and admired.
						As we face new challenges and increase our presence in rapidly changing markets, one thing that must never change is our unfaltering commitment to our values and the highest ethical standards. These core values and standards are the foundation of the unique UNIDEL culture that differentiates us, builds our brand, and inspires our customers and vendors.
						Our Code of Conduct is and will always be our main theme. The Code sets the expectations for integrity and ethics that I expect all employees to follow.
						The code is also applicable to all our vendors / suppliers / partners in the eco-system and I encourage them to read it, discuss it, and commit to upholding it. If you have any questions or concerns please contact our CEOs, our Ethics champion or you may simply write to ask.ethics@unidel-group.com
						I look forward to your continued commitment to live our values working with us, each and every day.
